    <h1>Amazon Forest</h1>
    <p>The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that
         covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 5,500,000 km2
          (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally 
          acknowledged indigenous territories.

        The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, 
        Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level
         administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The 
         Amazon represents over half of Earth's remaining rainforests,[3] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of
          tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.[4]
        
        More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different
         national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of
          the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.[5]
        
        Large scale deforestation is occurring in the forest, creating different harmful effects. Economic losses due to deforestation in 
        Brazil could be approximately 7 times higher in comparison to the cost of all commodities produced through deforestation. In 2023,
         the World Bank published a report proposing a non-deforestation based economic program in the region.[6][7]
        
        Etymology
        The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes. The women of the tribe 
        fought alongside the men, as was their custom.[8] Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described
         by Herodotus and Diodorus.[8]

         rivers
        Based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, human inhabitants first settled in the Amazon region
         at least 11,200 years ago.[10] Subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by AD 1250, which induced alterations in the forest cover.[11]
        
        For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a 
        large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as 
        described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per 
        square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a
         larger population.[12] However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. 
         The Upano Valley sites in present-day eastern Ecuador predate all known complex Amazonian societies.[13]
        
        Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó,
         and inland dwellers.[14] Based on projections of food production, one estimate suggests over 8 million people living in the 
         Amazon in 1492.[15] By 1900, the native indigenous population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.
         [14]
        
        The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542.[16] The BBC's Unnatural Histories
         presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that
          a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. The Pre-Columbian agriculture in the Amazon Basin was 
          sufficiently advanced to support prosperous and populous societies. It is believed that civilization was later devastated by 
          the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox.[17] This civilization was investigated by the British explorer Percy 
          Fawcett in the early twentieth century. The results of his expeditions were inconclusive, and he disappeared mysteriously on his 
          last trip. His name for this lost civilization was the City of Z.[citation needed]
        
        Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 1–1250, furthering claims about 
        Pre-Columbian civilizations.[18][19] Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977, and Alceu Ranzi
         is credited with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre.[17][20] The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence
          that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through 
          practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.[17] Terra preta is found over large areas in the Amazon forest; and is now 
          widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture
           in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of 
           human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.[21] In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of 
           some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of 
            University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.[22]
        
        In the Amazonas, there has been fighting and wars between the neighboring tribes of the Jivaro. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, 
        including the Shuar, practised headhunting for trophies and headshrinking.[23] The accounts of missionaries to the area in the 
        borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the Yanomami tribes. More than a third of the Y
        anomamo males, on average, died from warfare.[24][when?]
        
        The Munduruku were a warlike tribe that expanded along the Tapajós river and its tributaries and were feared by neighboring tribes.
         In the early 19th century, the Munduruku were pacified and subjugated by the Brazilians.[25]
        
        During the Amazon rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native 
        Amazonians.[26]
        
        In the 1950s, Brazilian explorer and defender of indigenous people, Cândido Rondon, supported the Villas-Bôas brothers' campaign,
         which faced strong opposition from the government and the ranchers of Mato Grosso and led to the establishment of the first Brazilian 
         National Park for indigenous people along the Xingu River in 1961.[27]
        

        In 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by an uncontacted Amazon tribe known as the Panará.[28]
        
        The Matsés made their first permanent contact with the outside world in 1969. Before that date, they were effectively at-war with
         the Peruvian government.[29]
